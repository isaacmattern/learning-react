# Learning React

I am following through (Scrimba's Free React Tutorial)[https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact] so that I can learn React and be encouraged to work individually using the concepts I learn to create projects from mockups. I am learning React in hopes of developing a small, but fully-functioning responsive application with a backend and authentication.

I am starting this course on February 24, 2022.
